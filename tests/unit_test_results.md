### Bookings

## Fixed Issues
1. **User Profile Update (500 Error)**: Fixed by properly handling password updates and adding error handling.
   - Added proper password hashing when a new password is provided
   - Added try-except block with appropriate error handling
   - Added logging for better debugging

## Remaining Challenges
1. Creating bookings through test_setup.py script failed with a 422 error - missing user_id field.
2. Some tests were skipped due to lack of test data, which could be addressed by improving the test_setup.py script.

## Recommendations
1. Update the booking creation API to include the user_id from the authentication token rather than requiring it in the request.
2. Enhance test_setup.py to ensure proper creation of test data for all test cases.
3. Implement proper error handling on all endpoints to avoid 500 errors.
