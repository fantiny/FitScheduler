# Alembic Database Migrations

This directory contains database migration scripts for the BSweetOrder Yoyaku application.

## Overview

- Alembic is used to track and apply database schema changes
- Migration files in the versions/ directory represent the evolution of the database schema
- Each migration has an upgrade() and downgrade() function

## Common Commands

```bash
# Create a new migration (automatically detecting changes)
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of changes"

# Apply all pending migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Downgrade to a specific revision
alembic downgrade <revision_id>

# Check current database version
alembic current

# Show migration history
alembic history
```

## Project Structure

- versions/ - Contains migration script files
- env.py - Alembic environment configuration
- script.py.mako - Template for new migration scripts
